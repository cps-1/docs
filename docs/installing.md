# Installing CPS1

CPS1 is installed on a Kubernetes cluster to transparently handle all necessary operations that support our core features.

We support all major managed Kubernetes vendors, including Amazon EKS, Azure AKS, Google GKE, and Oracle EKS.

We currently require GitHub or GitLab as identity providers and source code repositories.

At this moment, a detailed deployment guide is available only to CPS1 customers and will be made publicly available soon.

CPS1 uses a per-active-user pricing model for its subscription license.

A user becomes active after their first login and remains so until deactivated.

Your organization can use CPS1 with up to 10 active users at no charge, without the need for a license key.

If you require more than 10 active users, please contact our sales team at [contact@cps1.tech](mailto:contact@cps1.tech) for additional information.
