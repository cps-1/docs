# Licensing

CPS1 uses a per-active-user pricing model for its subscription license.

A user becomes active after their first login and remains so until deactivated.

Your organization can use CPS1 with up to 10 active users at no charge, without the need for a license key.

If you require more than 10 active users, please contact our sales team at [contact@cps1.tech](mailto:contact@cps1.tech) for additional information.
