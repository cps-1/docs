# What is CPS1?

CPS1 is a self-hosted solution deployed on your Kubernetes cluster, enhancing development workflows with an intuitive templating engine that automates the provisioning of ephemeral development environments.

Platform engineers can easily customize and extend CPS1, eliminate manual setup, and enforce consistency in ephemeral environments, while offering developers self-service and the flexibility they need.

CPS1 tackles the challenges of modern software development, empowering platform engineers to easily deliver a great development experience.

## Why CPS1 was created

We believe that, given the complexity and other characteristics of modern systems, development must take place on a managed cloud infrastructure with automation, rather than locally on each contributor's laptop.

This change is essential to increasing software development and delivery capabilities by 10x while maintaining quality and consistency, all without increasing the number of people involved.

To achieve the results of our vision, we believe changing the paradigm and moving away from local development environments is the best path forward.

It is also crucial to make the transition seamless from laptop-based local environments to the cloud by utilizing automation, eliminating the need for labor-intensive manual updates of software projects.

## What is a Cloud Development Environment

A Cloud Development Environment (CDE) consists of pre-configured software development tools that are accessible in the cloud and on demand. It includes all the necessary dependencies, allowing developers to start coding within moments, without the need for local installation and configuration on their computers.

This paradigm offers several advantages, such as:

- Standardized and centrally managed environments: Development environments are always stable and ready for coding.
- Access to powerful cloud resources: Leverage powerful cloud machines without being limited by local CPU and memory constraints.
- Automatic updates and security patches: Library and toolchain updates are always current, eliminating the need for local maintenance.
- Portability: Code from anywhere, at any time, with a consistent environment that matches production.
- Enhanced collaboration: Facilitates easy remote collaboration and troubleshooting.

Fundamentally, Cloud Development Environments (CDEs) shift the paradigm from local coding on laptops to remote development. To learn more about CDEs and the advantages of this paradigm shift, here are four recommended articles for a deeper understanding of the subject:
