# Welcome to Cloud Programming Shell (CPS1) Official Documentation

## What is Cloud Programming Shell?

**Cloud Programming Shell (CPS1) is a unified Platform Orchestrator and Cloud Development Environment solution.**

It provides Platform Engineers and SREs with the governance and cost-controls they need, while giving developers the flexibility and speed they demand.

CPS1 is a self-hosted solution deployed on your Kubernetes cluster, enhancing development workflows with a unifed provisioning of ephemeral development environments.

Platform Engineers can easily customize and extend CPS1, eliminate manual setup, and enforce consistency, while offering developers the flexibility to create, test, and iterate quickly.

## What makes CPS1 different?

1. **Platform Orchestrator and Cloud Development Environmets combined**
Unlike CDEs that require external tools for infrastructure management, CPS1 has orchestration built-in. It manages the lifecycle of the environment, from initial provisioning to automatic suspension (cost-saving) and decommissioning.

2. **Self-Service Provisioning**
CPS1 empowers developers to spin up full-stack environments including databases, caches, and cloud resources from pre-approved Templates defined by Platform Engineers. No tickets, no delays.

3. **The "Golden Path" for Standardization**
CPS1 provides a "Packages and Resources" catalog that SREs and Platform Engineers can easily customize and extend to include specific versions of languages, tools, and dependencies. This ensures every developer is working in a production-aligned environment, eliminating the gap between local and cloud.

4. **Ephemeral Environment Management**
Move away from "forever" staging environments. CPS1 creates isolated, on-demand workspaces for every branch or feature, allowing for true end-to-end testing in a production-aligned environment.

5. **Self-Hosted Solution**
CPS1 is self-hosted and deployed directly on your Kubernetes cluster, giving organizations more control over their infrastructure, security, and scalability compared to cloud-based solutions.

6. **No New Skills Required for Platform Engineers**
Platform Engineers can adopt and use CPS1 quickly without needing to learn new technologies or tools, thanks to its simple setup.

7. **Reduces Cognitive Load for Developers and Platform Engineers**
CPS1 is designed to reduce cognitive load, making both development and management simpler. This means less mental overhead for both developers and platform engineers, allowing them to focus on what really matters.

8. **Focus on Developer Experience**
With an emphasis on reducing friction in both development and platform management, CPS1 prioritizes a seamless experience for all users, whether they’re platform engineers customizing environments or developers using them.
